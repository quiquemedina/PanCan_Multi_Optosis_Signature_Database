# Pancan multipoptosis
Integrated Multi-Optosis Model for Pan-Cancer Biomarker and Therapy Target Discovery - This repository hosts the PanCan_Multi_Optosis_Signature_Database, an expansive resource detailing multi-omic signatures across 25 regulated cell death forms in 33 cancer types. Developed within the framework of the Integrated Multi-Optosis Model, this database enables researchers to systematically explore the associations between genomic, transcriptomic, and phenotypic features and clinical outcomes across cancer. By facilitating real-time access to signature data, the repository supports novel biomarker discovery and translational insights, emphasizing actionable targets in cancer therapy. This tool is pivotal for advancing precision oncology through comprehensive data-driven approaches, offering an invaluable asset for scientists, clinicians, and developers alike.
